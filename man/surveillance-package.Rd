  \pkg{surveillance} is an \R package implementing statistical methods
  for the retrospective modeling and prospective change-point detection
  in time series of counts, proportions and categorical data. The main
  application is in the detection of aberrations in routine collected
  public health data seen as univariate and multivariate time series of
  counts or point-processes. However, applications could just as well
  originate from environmetrics, econometrics or social sciences. As
  many methods rely on statistical process control methodology, the
  package is thus also relevant to quality control and reliability
  engineering.

  The fundamental data structure of the package is an S4 class
  \code{sts} wrapping observations, monitoring results and date handling
  for multivariate time series. Currently the package contains
  implementations typical outbreak detection procedures such as Stroup et
  al. (1989), Farrington et al., (1996), Rossi et al. (1999), Rogerson
  and Yamada (2001), a Bayesian approach (H\enc{ö}{oe}hle, 2007),
  negative binomial CUSUM methods (H\enc{ö}{oe}hle and Mazick, 2009), and a
  detector based on generalized likelihood ratios (H\enc{ö}{oe}hle
  and Paul, 2008). However, also CUSUMs for the prospective change-point
  detection in binomial, beta-binomial and multinomial time series is
  covered based on generalized linear modelling.  This includes
  e.g. paired binary CUSUM described by Steiner et al. (1999) or paired
  comparison Bradley-Terry modelling described in H\enc{ö}{oe}hle
  (2010). The package contains several real-world datasets, the ability
  to simulate outbreak data, visualize the results of the monitoring in
  temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal fashion.

  Furthermore, the package contains inference methods for the
  retrospective infectious disease model in Held et al. (2005), Paul et
  al. (2008) ("algo.hhh") and Paul and Held (2011) ("hhh4") handling
  multivariate time series of counts. Furthermore, the fully Bayesian
  approach for univariate time series of counts from Held et al. (2006)
  ("twins") is also implemented. Self-exciting spatio-temporal point
  processes are modeled through additive-multiplicative conditional
  intensities as described in H\enc{ö}{oe}hle (2009) ("twinSIR") and
  Meyer et al (2012) ("twinstim").

  Altogether, the package allows the modelling and monitoring of
  epidemic phenomena in temporal and spatio-temporal contexts.
