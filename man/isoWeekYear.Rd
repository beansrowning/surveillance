\title{Find ISO week and ISO year of a vector of Date objects on Windows}
\description{
  This function extracts the ISO week and ISO year of a \code{Date}
  according to the ISO 8601 specification. Note that this function
  does nothing else than format.Date(x, "\%G") and format.Date(x, "\%V")
  would do on Mac/Unix computers. However, this is not implemented
  on Windows.

  A small internal wrapper for \code{format.Date} (called
  \code{formatDate}) thus directs all calls having one of these format
  strings to this function, if the \code{.Platform$OS.type}
  information reveals a Windows system. The function also provides three
  additional \code{strptime} formatting strings: "\%Q" (the quarter of a
  date as a numeric), "%OQ" (the quarter of a date in roman) and "%q"
  (day within the quarter). These are, e.g., used by \code{linelist2sts}.
