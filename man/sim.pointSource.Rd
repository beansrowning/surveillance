\title{Generation of Simulated Point Source Epidemy}
\description{Simulation of epidemies which were introduced by point sources.
        The basis of this programme is a combination of a Hidden Markov Modell
        (to get random timepoints for outbreaks) and a simple model
        (compare \code{\link{sim.seasonalNoise}}) to simulate the baseline.
}
\usage{
    sim.pointSource(p = 0.99, r = 0.01, length = 400, A = 1, 
        alpha = 1, beta = 0, phi = 0, frequency = 1, state = NULL, K)
}
\arguments{
        \item{p}{probability to get a new outbreak at time i if there was one at time i-1, default 0.99.}
        \item{r}{probability to get no new outbreak at time i if there was none at time i-1, default 0.01.}
        \item{length}{number of weeks to model, default 400. \code{length} is ignored if \code{state}
                        is given. In this case the length of \code{state} is used.}
        \item{A}{amplitude (range of sinus), default = 1.}
        \item{alpha}{parameter to move along the y-axis (negative values not allowed)
                       with alpha > = A, default = 1.}
        \item{beta}{regression coefficient, default = 0.}
        \item{phi}{factor to create seasonal moves
                        (moves the curve along the x-axis), default = 0.}
        \item{frequency}{factor to determine the oscillation-frequency, default = 1.}
        \item{state}{use a state chain to define the status at this timepoint (outbreak or not).
                If not given a Markov chain is generated by the programme, default NULL.}
        \item{K}{additional weigth for an outbreak which influences the distribution
                parameter mu, default = 0.}
}
\value{
        \item{disProg}{a object \code{disProg} (disease progress) including a list of the observed, the state chain
                and nearly all input parameters.
        }
